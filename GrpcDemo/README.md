# gRPC Integration Demo

This sample solution shows how to add a gRPC service to an ABP Framework based web application and consume it from a console application.

* The sample is **based on the [Microsoft's tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/grpc/grpc-start)**.
* **See [this commit](https://github.com/abpframework/abp-samples/commit/9c62d1abe4809f18e5281b6595eb9a139fb7add3)** for all the changes made to a new application created via ABP CLI.
* The sample application uses ASP.NET Core MVC UI & EF Core, however nothing different for any other kind of UI framework or database provider.
